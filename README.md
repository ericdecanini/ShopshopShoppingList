# ShopshopShoppingList

Shopshop Shopping List is an app currently being created by Eric Decanini

This app is being created to showcase plenty of standard Android best practices in conjunction with using Chaquopy (Python code) to access the SQLite DB as an internal backend to store data.

TODO:
- Create app icon
- Implement free and premium versions
- Create a better splash screen for empty

Bugs:
- Checking items resets quantity
- Shopping list title doesn't accept special characters
- Banner ad takes space when not loaded
