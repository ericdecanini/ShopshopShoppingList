# ShopshopShoppingList

Shopshop Shopping List is an app currently being created by Eric Decanini

This app is being created to showcase plenty of standard Android best practices in conjunction with using Chaquopy (Python code) to access the SQLite DB as an internal backend to store data.

TODO:

- Add positions to db
- Add peaking quantity bar
- Type number in
- Do for dark mode

Bugs:
- Banner ad takes space when not loaded (intermittent)
